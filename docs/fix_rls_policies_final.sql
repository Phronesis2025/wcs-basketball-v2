-- Final fix for RLS policies - more permissive approach
-- Drop all existing policies first
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own messages, admins can delete any" ON public.coach_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own replies, admins can delete any" ON public.coach_message_replies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Coaches and admins can view all messages" ON public.coach_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Coaches and admins can view all replies" ON public.coach_message_replies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view non-deleted messages" ON public.coach_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert messages" ON public.coach_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own messages" ON public.coach_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view non-deleted replies" ON public.coach_message_replies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert replies" ON public.coach_message_replies;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own replies" ON public.coach_message_replies;

-- Create very permissive policies for now to test
-- For messages
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to view non-deleted messages"
  ON public.coach_messages FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND deleted_at IS NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to insert messages"
  ON public.coach_messages FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to update messages"
  ON public.coach_messages FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- For replies
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to view non-deleted replies"
  ON public.coach_message_replies FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND deleted_at IS NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to insert replies"
  ON public.coach_message_replies FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to update replies"
  ON public.coach_message_replies FOR UPDATE
