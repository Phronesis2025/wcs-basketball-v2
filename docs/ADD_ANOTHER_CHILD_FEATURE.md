# üë∂ Add Another Child Feature

**Created**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Allow parents to easily register additional children with pre-filled parent information

---

## üéâ **Feature Overview**

Parents can now easily add additional children to their account without re-entering their contact information. The parent's details are automatically pre-filled from their existing profile.

---

## ‚úÖ **What's Been Implemented**

### **1. New Add Child Page** (`/add-child`)

- **Pre-filled parent information** (read-only)
- **Empty child form** for new player details
- **Authentication required** (redirects to login if not authenticated)
- **Success feedback** after adding child

### **2. Updated Parent Profile**

- **"Add Another Child" button** now links to `/add-child` instead of `/register`
- **Seamless user experience** for existing parents

### **3. Smart Data Loading**

- **Automatically loads** parent data from existing children
- **Pre-fills contact information** from first registered child
- **Handles missing data** gracefully

---

## üéØ **User Experience Flow**

### **For Existing Parents:**

1. **Parent logs in** to their profile at `/parent/profile`
2. **Clicks "Add Another Child"** button
3. **Redirected to** `/add-child` page
4. **Sees pre-filled parent information** (read-only, blue box)
5. **Fills out only child details**:
   - Child's first name
   - Child's last name
   - Date of birth
   - Grade
   - Gender
   - Waiver agreement
6. **Submits form** ‚Üí Child is registered
7. **Redirected back** to parent profile with success message

### **For New Parents:**

- **Still use** `/register` for first child registration
- **Creates parent account** + registers first child
- **Then can use** `/add-child` for additional children

---

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **New Route**: `/add-child`

- **File**: `src/app/add-child/page.tsx`
- **Authentication**: Required (redirects to login)
- **Data Source**: Loads from existing children via `/api/parent/profile`

### **Updated Route**: `/parent/profile`

- **File**: `src/app/parent/profile/page.tsx`
- **Button Link**: Changed from `/register` to `/add-child`

### **API Integration**

- **Uses existing** `/api/register-player` endpoint
- **Uses existing** `/api/parent/profile` endpoint
- **No new API routes** needed
