    <h1>Cost Estimate Breakdown for Developing the WCS Basketball Web Application</h1>
    <p>This breakdown is based on the provided development specification document. I've used the estimated development times from the document as a foundation, interpreting them as man-weeks (assuming 40 hours per week) for a professional development team.</p>
    <p>Key assumptions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blended hourly rate: $120/hour (typical for a US-based or high-quality professional team, including frontend/backend devs, a project manager, and QA; rates can vary by locationâ€”offshore teams might be 50-70% lower).</li>
        <li>Total estimated man-hours: Approximately 1,080 hours (derived from the document's realistic 20-24 week estimate, averaged and broken down).</li>
        <li>Costs include development, basic testing, and integration but exclude ongoing maintenance, hosting (e.g., Supabase/Vercel fees), or post-launch support.</li>
        <li>Breakdown follows the document's structure, focusing on major sections like architecture, pages (grouped), database, features, and technical details. Overlaps (e.g., real-time in pages) are accounted for in allocations.</li>
        <li>Estimates are approximate; actual costs depend on team size, experience, scope changes, and location. For precision, get quotes from agencies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Range: $100,000 - $150,000 (depending on team location, exact scope, and efficiencies like using boilerplates). This aligns with industry averages for a mid-complexity full-stack web app with real-time features and custom components.</p>
