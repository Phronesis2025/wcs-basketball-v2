## 🛠️ Technical Changes

### File Upload Refactoring

**Files Modified**:

- `src/app/api/upload/team-update/route.ts` - New API route for team update image uploads
- `src/app/admin/club-management/page.tsx` - Updated to use API routes instead of server actions
- `src/lib/actions.ts` - Enhanced logging for file uploads

**Migration from Server Actions to API Routes**:

- **Reason**: Server actions have payload size limits for binary data
- **Solution**: Created dedicated API routes for file uploads
- **Benefits**: Better error handling, no timeout issues, proper streaming support

### "All Teams" Implementation

**Files Modified**:

- `src/app/admin/club-management/page.tsx` - Global event handling in all creation handlers
- `next.config.ts` - Fixed invalid configuration

**Key Changes**:

1. `handleCreateUpdate`: Converts `__GLOBAL__` to `team_id: null, is_global: true`
2. `handleCreateSchedule`: Handles global events for games/practices
3. `handleCreateDrill`: Prevents global drills (not supported)
4. Default team selection for admins on Coach tab

### Database Schema

- ✅ **team_updates.is_global**: Boolean flag for global updates
- ✅ **schedules.is_global**: Boolean flag for global schedules
- ✅ **Foreign Keys**: Both `team_id` columns allow NULL for global records
