<h1>WCS Basketball – Walkthrough & Discussion Outline</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Purpose of Meeting</h2>
  <p>
    A friendly, hands-on walkthrough of the new WCS Basketball website — highlighting how it benefits parents, coaches, and the club overall.
    The goal is to gather feedback, spark ideas, and discuss next steps for transferring ownership and ongoing management through the new LLC.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Meeting Flow (Approx. 10–20 Minutes)</h2>

  <div class="section-title">1. Warm-Up & Vision (2–3 min)</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Begin with a relaxed conversation: <em>“Where do you see WCS going in the next 1, 2, or 5 years?”</em></li>
    <li>Ask about any long-term ideas — growth, expansion, or outreach.</li>
    <li>Lightly introduce how the site aligns with that vision of growth and professionalism.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-title">2. Site Introduction (1–2 min)</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Open the live site on his computer and phone: <a href="https://wcs-basketball-v2.vercel.app">wcs-basketball-v2.vercel.app</a></li>
    <li>Explain that it’s hosted on <strong>Vercel</strong> and tied to their club domain.</li>
    <li>Mention that it’s a <strong>Progressive Web App</strong> — runs like a native app but easier to manage and install.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-title">3. Guided Walkthrough (8–10 min)</div>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> Show the hero banner, animated basketball effect, and fan zone — sets a professional tone.</li>
    <li><strong>Teams Page:</strong> Explore the grid layout and coach details; emphasize how easy it is for parents to find info.</li>
    <li><strong>Schedules Page:</strong> Demonstrate the mobile-friendly calendar and color-coded events.</li>
    <li><strong>Coaches Dashboard:</strong> Log in as a coach to show how updates, practices, and drills are managed.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice Drills:</strong> Highlight the organized drill library and its potential for coaches to collaborate.</li>
    <li>Show mobile view to reinforce how accessible and simple it is for parents.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-title">4. Discussion & Benefits (4–5 min)</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk through the key benefits for:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Parents:</strong> One location for all team info; mobile-friendly; real-time updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Coaches:</strong> Easy scheduling, drill sharing, and communication tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Club:</strong> Professional image and scalable foundation for growth.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Discuss how this modern system reflects the 25-year legacy of WCS while preparing for the future.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-title">5. Next Steps (2–3 min)</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Explain the path toward transferring the site to the club via your LLC.</li>
    <li>Share that your LLC could act as WCS’s <strong>first sponsor</strong> — donating back the initial build fee to the club.</li>
    <li>Clarify ongoing maintenance options and low monthly costs for hosting.</li>
    <li>Invite feedback on the structure and timeline before formalizing anything.</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Presentation Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep the tone friendly and open — like a coach’s meeting rather than a sales pitch.</li>
    <li>Use his computer and phone to show how seamless the experience is across devices.</li>
    <li>Encourage questions throughout rather than saving them for the end.</li>
    <li>End by emphasizing collaboration — that this site is built for the club, not just delivered to it.</li>
  </ul>
