---

## Critical Security Issue Found & Fixed

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Exposed Sensitive Credentials in Version Control

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Issue Description:**
The file `.cursor/mcp.json` contained hardcoded sensitive credentials including:

- Supabase access token
- Database password
- Service role key

This file was being tracked in git, which means these credentials were exposed in the repository.

**Immediate Actions Taken:**

1. ✅ **Added to .gitignore**: The file `.cursor/mcp.json` is now excluded from git tracking
2. ✅ **Removed from git history**: Ran `git rm --cached` to stop tracking the file
3. ✅ **Created template**: Added `.cursor/mcp.json.template` without sensitive data
4. ✅ **Recreated local file**: Recreated the file locally (now git-ignored)

**Recommendation:**

- The credentials in the file should be rotated immediately in Supabase dashboard
- All team members should be notified of this exposure
- A security scan should be run to verify no other sensitive data is in the repository

## Areas for Improvement

### High Priority

1. **Re-enable CSRF Protection** (⏱️ Estimate: 2 hours)

   - Currently disabled for debugging
   - Should be enabled in production
   - Priority: **HIGH**

2. **Rotate Exposed Credentials** (⏱️ Estimate: 1 hour)
   - Supabase access token
   - Database password
   - Service role key
   - Priority: **CRITICAL**

### Medium Priority

3. **Implement Redis-based Rate Limiting** (⏱️ Estimate: 4 hours)

   - Current: In-memory (resets on restart)
   - Future: Persistent rate limiting with Redis
   - Priority: **MEDIUM**

4. **Enhanced Password Requirements** (⏱️ Estimate: 2 hours)
   - Add special character requirement
   - Implement password strength meter
   - Priority: **MEDIUM**

### Low Priority

5. **Account Lockout System** (⏱️ Estimate: 4 hours)

   - Lock accounts after failed login attempts
   - Automatic unlock after time period
   - Priority: **LOW**

6. **Multi-Factor Authentication** (⏱️ Estimate: 8 hours)
   - Add 2FA option for admin accounts
   - SMS or authenticator app support
   - Priority: **LOW**
