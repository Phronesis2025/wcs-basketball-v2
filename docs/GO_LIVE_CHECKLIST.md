## 📧 Email Configuration

### Email Service Setup (Resend)

**Action Required**: Configure Resend API and email addresses for production.

#### ✅ Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Resend API Key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_[your-production-resend-api-key]

# Resend From Address
# Update this to your verified domain email address
RESEND_FROM="WCS Basketball <noreply@yourdomain.com>"
# OR if using Resend's test domain:
# RESEND_FROM="WCS Basketball <onboarding@resend.dev>"

# Admin Email Notifications
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Update this for production!
# For testing: Use your email only
ADMIN_NOTIFICATIONS_TO=your-email@example.com

# For production: Add all 3 admin emails (comma-separated)
# ADMIN_NOTIFICATIONS_TO=admin1@example.com,admin2@example.com,admin3@example.com
```

**How to configure:**

1. **Get Resend API Key:**
   - Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key for production
   - Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

2. **Verify Domain (Recommended for Production):**
   - Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
   - Add and verify your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
   - Update `RESEND_FROM` to use your verified domain
   - Example: `WCS Basketball <noreply@yourdomain.com>`

3. **Configure Admin Email Notifications:**
   - **For Testing Phase**: Set `ADMIN_NOTIFICATIONS_TO` to just your email
     ```
     ADMIN_NOTIFICATIONS_TO=your-email@example.com
     ```
   - **For Production Launch**: Update to include all 3 admin emails (comma-separated, no spaces)
     ```
     ADMIN_NOTIFICATIONS_TO=admin1@example.com,admin2@example.com,admin3@example.com
     ```
   - **How it works:**
     - Single email: Sends directly to that address
     - Multiple emails: Sends to first email, BCCs the others (maintains privacy)

**Email Flow When Player Signs Up:**
- ✅ Parent receives: Registration confirmation email with player details
- ✅ Admin(s) receive: Notification email with player and parent information for team assignment

**Email Flow When Payment is Received:**
- ✅ Parent receives: Payment confirmation email with receipt details
- ✅ Admin(s) receive: Payment confirmation notification with player, parent, and payment information

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Test parent registration email is received
- [ ] Test admin notification email is received
- [ ] Test parent payment confirmation email is received
- [ ] Test admin payment confirmation email is received
- [ ] Verify email formatting and links work correctly
- [ ] Check spam folders
