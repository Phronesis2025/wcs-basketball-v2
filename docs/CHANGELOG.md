# WCS Basketball v2.0 - Changelog

## 🚀 Version 2.9.9 - Performance Optimizations & Core Web Vitals Improvements

**Release Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Production Ready ✅  
**Focus**: Performance Optimization & Core Web Vitals  

---

### ⚡ Performance Improvements

- **Core Web Vitals Optimization**:
  - **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Fixed layout stability issues by adding proper image dimensions and aspect ratios
  - **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: Improved initial load time through font preloading and resource hints
  - **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: Reduced server response time with API route caching strategies

- **Image Layout Stability**:
  - Fixed team image on team detail pages: Added explicit `width={800}`, `height={384}`, and `aspectRatio: "800/384"` to prevent layout shift
  - Fixed drill page images: Replaced `height: "auto"` with proper `aspectRatio: "400/192"` styling
  - All images using `fill` prop already have proper `aspect-ratio` containers (FanZone, TeamUpdates components)

- **Font & Resource Preloading**:
  - Added preload links for critical fonts (Bebas Neue, Inter) with `crossOrigin="anonymous"` for faster FCP
  - Added preload for hero image (`/hero-basketball.jpg`) with `fetchPriority="high"` for improved LCP
  - Optimized Hero video loading: Changed `preload` from default to `"metadata"` to reduce initial load impact

- **API Route Caching**:
  - Implemented `Cache-Control` headers with stale-while-revalidate strategy:
    - `/api/schedules`: `s-maxage=30, stale-while-revalidate=60` (30 seconds cache, 60 seconds stale window)
    - `/api/teams`: `s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=120` (60 seconds cache, 120 seconds stale window)
  - Allows CDN/edge caching for faster TTFB while maintaining data freshness through background revalidation

### 📊 Core Web Vitals Tracking

- **Custom Web Vitals Dashboard**:
  - Added Core Web Vitals section to Monitor tab in admin dashboard
  - Displays real-time metrics: LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, and TTFB
  - Color-coded status indicators (Green: Good, Yellow: Needs Improvement, Red: Poor)
  - Diagnostic information with expandable panels showing causes and fixes for poor metrics

- **Web Vitals Diagnostics**:
  - Created `WebVitalsDiagnostic` component with actionable insights
  - Shows common causes and recommended fixes for metrics that need improvement
  - Helps administrators identify and resolve performance issues quickly

### 🔧 Technical Details

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/app/teams/[id]/page.tsx`: Fixed team image dimensions and aspect ratio
  - `src/app/layout.tsx`: Added font and hero image preloading
  - `src/components/Hero.tsx`: Optimized video preload strategy
  - `src/app/api/schedules/route.ts`: Added caching headers
  - `src/app/api/teams/route.ts`: Added caching headers
  - `src/app/drills/page.tsx`: Fixed image aspect ratio
  - `src/components/WebVitalsDiagnostics.tsx`: Created diagnostic component with red formatting fixes

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Before**: CLS: 0.10 (needs improvement), FCP: 4446ms (poor), TTFB: 1935ms (poor)
  - **Target**: CLS: < 0.1 (good), FCP: < 1800ms (good), TTFB: < 600ms (good)
  - All optimizations maintain existing layouts, functions, and formatting - performance-only changes

### 📝 Notes

- All performance optimizations are non-breaking changes
- No layout, functionality, or formatting modifications
- Caching strategy balances freshness (30-60 seconds) with speed (instant cache responses)
- Font preloading improves perceived performance without blocking render
- Image aspect ratios prevent layout shift during image loading

**IMPORTANT**: All red buttons must use this exact format for consistency:

```css
className="px-6 py-2 text-sm font-semibold text-white bg-[red] hover:bg-[#b80000] rounded-md transition-colors disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
```

**Key Elements:**

- `bg-[red]` - Primary red background
- `hover:bg-[#b80000]` - Darker red on hover
- `text-white` - White text for contrast
- `px-6 py-2` - Standard padding
- `text-sm font-semibold` - Typography
- `rounded-md` - Border radius
- `transition-colors` - Smooth color transitions
- `disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed` - Disabled states

**Usage**: Apply to all delete buttons, confirmation buttons, and destructive action buttons.
